In this project, I created a game of Tic-Tac-Toe between two players.

The game will allow the players to choose their name and board markers, as the players progress through the game, they will receive updates on the current state of the board. The game will declare either a winner or a draw, then allow the users to restart the game.

The main goal of the project was to test and grow my Object Oriented Programming knowledge.
